## About

Born in Romania, studying CS in Italy at the University of Pisa. 
I love the way technology changed our lives and I want to contribute to that change too.
I also like travelling, taking photos or just binge-watching tons of TV series. 

If you like this page or you just want to thank me for any reason, feel free to support my caffeine addiction by [*offering me a coffee*](https://ko-fi.com/A720Q4).
I would really appreciate that! You know: *life starts after coffee*! (:
